GOAL: Very compact host discovery summary from the scan output below.

OUTPUT RULES:
1. One line per discovered target (skip hosts with no open/filtered ports info)
2. Format: IP | Up | <#ports> | KeySvc
3. KeySvc = most interesting detected service (short name) or '-' if none
4. Truncate each line to remain very short (LCD friendly)
5. DO NOT add explanations, headers or extra text

PRIORITIZE:
- Live hosts
- Count of open ports
- Single notable service (http/ssh/smb/rdp/mysql/etc.)

If more than 10 hosts, only list the 10 with the highest number of open ports (tie-break by IP ascending).
