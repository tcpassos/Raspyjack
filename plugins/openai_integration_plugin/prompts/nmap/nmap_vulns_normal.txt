GOAL: Structured vulnerability summary with severity & action.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
IP <ip>
	Finding: <id/shortname> Sev:<L/M/H/C> Port:<p>/<proto> Svc:<svc>
	Action: <1 short remediation or exploit step>

RULES:
- Group by host; multiple findings allowed (max 3 per host, choose highest severity).
- Severity mapping: Critical(C)=remote code exec/default creds; High(H)=priv esc/serious info leak; Medium(M)=enumeration leverage; Low(L)=minor.
- Action examples: patch, upgrade, brute, enum_shares, exploit_<id>, ssl_scan, weak_ciphers, default_creds.
- Keep each Action under ~5 words.
- Order hosts by highest severity present.
- After all: Totals: C:<nC> H:<nH> M:<nM> L:<nL>
