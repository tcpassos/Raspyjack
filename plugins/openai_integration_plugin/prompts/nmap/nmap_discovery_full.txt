GOAL: Detailed discovery plus quick prioritization.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
SUMMARY:
	Live Hosts: <count> | Total Open: <sum> | High Value: <count_high_value_hosts>
PRIORITY (Top 5 by potential value):
	<ip> -> <primary reason (e.g. many ports, web, smb, db, old ssh)>
HOSTS:
	<ip>
		Open: <port/proto(s) list; group common services>
		Notable: <concise service/version highlights; vuln script hints if present>
		SurfaceScore: <LOW|MED|HIGH> (based on count & critical services)

RULES:
- Derive High Value / SurfaceScore from: number of open ports, presence of remote mgmt (ssh/rdp/winrm/vnc), data services (db, smb), web stack, legacy or anonymous services.
- Compress ports (e.g. 80,81,443,8080 -> http-stack)
- If more than 12 hosts, summarize remaining as: +N others (low surface)
- Keep each host section within 4 lines total.
- Provide actionable but brief reasons (no long paragraphs).

END with a line: NEXT: run vuln/enumeration scans on HIGH targets.
