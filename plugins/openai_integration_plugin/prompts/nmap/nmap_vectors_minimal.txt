GOAL: Ultra-short attack vector hints per host.

FORMAT: One line per host:
IP: vec1, vec2, vec3

RULES:
- Max 3 vectors per host.
- Each vector 1-2 words (e.g. weak-ssh, web-http, smb-share, rdp, mysql, ftp-anon?)
- Omit hosts with only 1 low-value port (e.g. only 80) unless port is critical.
- List at most 10 hosts (choose those with most/highest impact services).
- No header, no footer.
