GOAL: Expanded attack surface mapping with actionable follow-ups.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
HOST <ip>
	Surface: <summary of key services & versions>
	Vectors: <vector1>, <vector2>, <vector3>, <vector4> (prioritized)
	Recommended:
		- <short command or action>
		- <short command or action>
	Notes: <concise risk/peculiarity if any>

RULES:
- Recommended entries: specific next actions (nmap -sV -pX, script categories, enum tools, exploit-db search terms, simple exploit syntax).
- Limit to 2 recommended bullet points unless host is clearly HIGH value (then 3).
- Use compact commands (no long flags beyond essentials).
- If vuln scripts already detected, integrate into vectors / recommended.
- Cap hosts to top 8 by combined importance (services criticality + variety + potential vulnerabilities).
- End with a FINAL line: Pivot Candidates: <ip1, ip2> (choose hosts offering lateral movement like smb, db, ldap, winrm).
