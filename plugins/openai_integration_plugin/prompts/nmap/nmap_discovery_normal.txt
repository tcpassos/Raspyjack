GOAL: Concise discovery & basic surface enumeration.

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
HEADER: Hosts: <total_live>  OpenPorts: <sum_open>
Then one block per host:
IP: <ip>
Ports: <port1/proto,port2/proto,...> (max 6 shown; use +N if truncated)
Key: <short note on standout service (e.g. http, smb, ssh outdated, etc.)>

RULES:
- Only include live hosts.
- Group ports by protocol implicitly (e.g. 22/tcp).
- Prefer noteworthy ports/services (http, https, ssh, rdp, smb, ftp, database, proxy, vpn, mail) when selecting first 6.
- Keep notes ultra brief; no full sentences.
- No extraneous commentary outside defined structure.

After all hosts add a FINAL line if any truncated: Note: some hosts truncated.
